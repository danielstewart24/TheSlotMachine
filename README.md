# Numbers: SLOT MACHINE

Sreenshots:



This edition is slightly different than most Slot Machine games. 
The idea behind this game is to explore a better winner opportunity for 
the user and put that into code. One of the ways I do that is by multiplying 
the amount betted from the inital wallet amount minus selected amount from the left radio buttons
by the value of one of the three matching numbers from the table of digits. 

This will render in the Winnings Display below the table. For each win (or loss)
a series of messages will be displayed to encourage the user to bet again. Once the user has
betted all the money in the wallet, the game is over and will reset. 

## Getting Started

Game is ready upon browser loading using the function startGame(). User will place 
their initial bet by selecting a radio button. This amount will be withdrawn from their
wallet and used to gamble at the table of digits. Once the user wins a round that money
will be deposited into their winnings display below the table. User may Cash Out at any time
and money will be "sent" to their linked bank. For your interest, the number of bets you've made
for the game will be in the corner to the right of the of the board. 

## Technologies Used

This Slot Machine game utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
to render a play-by-play user experience. 

## Next Steps

Some updates planned for the future include: casino background sounds and touch button clicks or rings
for each push of the Slot Machine button. Also, reinvesting the winnings back into the wallet
for the next round of gameplay so that financially the user can play longer.
